        "# Description:\n",
        "A company operates 7 days a week and needs to assign employees to daily shifts.\n",
        "The company must meet the minimum daily staffing requirements, and each employee\n",
        "is allowed to work a maximum number of days per week to avoid burnout. Employees\n",
        "have different hourly wages, and the shifts are 8 hours long. The objective is\n",
        "to schedule employees in a way that satisfies the following constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The minimum number of employees required for each day is met.\n",
        "2. No employee works more than their allowed maximum workdays in the week.\n",
        "3. The total cost of wages is minimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Definitions:\n",
        "- Number of employees: 5\n",
        "- Number of days: 7\n",
        "- Hourly wages for employees: [15, 20, 18, 22, 19] (in Euro per hour)\n",
        "- Maximum workdays per employee: [5, 5, 4, 4, 5]\n",
        "- Daily staffing requirements: [3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4] (number of employees required each day)\n",
        "- Shift duration: 8 hours\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal:\n",
        "To determine the optimal schedule that minimizes the total wage cost while adhering\n",
        "to the constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "- The optimal total cost of scheduling.\n",
        "- The daily work schedule for each employee."
